# CipherMaster

# CipherMaster is a versatile encryption and decryption program that supports both Caesar and Substitution ciphers. It allows users to securely encrypt plaintext into ciphertext using a specified key or shift value, and vice versa. The program also includes a decryption feature for the Caesar cipher, which can automatically test all possible shifts and match results against a given dictionary to find the most likely plaintext. Additionally, it supports cleaning up input text by removing non-alphabetic characters, making it more user-friendly. Whether you're looking to encrypt sensitive information or break simple ciphers, CipherMaster provides a robust solution for cryptographic challenges.
